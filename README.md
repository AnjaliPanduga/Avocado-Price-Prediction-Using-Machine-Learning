🥑 Avocado Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting avocado prices using historical data and multiple machine learning regression models.
The goal is to help businesses, retailers, and suppliers understand price trends, regional variations, and seasonal effects for better decision-making.

An interactive Streamlit web application is also developed to visualize data insights and perform real-time predictions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Avocado prices fluctuate based on multiple factors such as region, demand, seasonality, and type.
Accurate price prediction helps:

Optimize pricing strategies

Improve supply chain planning

Reduce losses due to price volatility

This project aims to build an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict avocado prices efficiently.

🧠 Project Workflow
