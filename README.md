# 🥑 Avocado Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts avocado prices based on historical data. It provides automated data analysis, price prediction, model comparison, and actionable business insights through an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload CSV dataset and perform automatic EDA
- Visualize price distributions and trends
- Predict avocado prices using Linear Regression
- Compare multiple regression models
- Identify the best-performing model
- Business-oriented insights and conclusions

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Prices vary significantly by region and avocado type
- Tree-based models handle non-linear patterns better
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance
